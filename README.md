# How to prepare for technical interviews at companies like Amazon, Flipkart, Google, Microsoft, Swiggy, Uber, etc?

## Interview Rounds

Generally, there are two major types of technical interviews that companies have in India:
- Problem Solving & Data Structures Round
- Machine Coding Round

If you're aiming the traditional giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc, then you should focus solely on problem-solving & data structures (PS/DS).

If you're aiming top startups like Uber, Flipkart, Swiggy, Udaan, Ola, Cred, etc, then you should prepare for machine coding round as well apart from PS/DS.

Most of the other companies will have a PS/DS round and many have started adding machine coding round as the first round.

## What to cover
For most of the above companies, you'll need to cover all of the common data structures and algorithms.

For machine coding, aim to write readable code, learn basic object-oriented programming and practice solving a few machine coding problems.

The most common data structures that you should master are Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, HashMap, Tree, Graph and Heap.

The most common types of algorithms are String Manipulation, Two Pointers, Searching, Sorting, Backtracking, Bit Manipulation, and Dynamic Programming.
